Microsoft Hackathon | Secure Electronic Voting using Azure Blockchain

So here's a little advancement over the latest EVMs. 

What i feel is that the latest EVM's still breach the privacy, let's say because of the person who is assisting us with the use of the machine.

How about having a relevant size of a board that has eye trackers intsalled.
> Once a voter sets his/her eye on a particular symbol out of many symbols present on the board, let's say for 5 seconds, that particular choice will be recorded instatntly.
> Such eye trackers will have to be very precise to capture the voter's target choice.

These eye trackers can further be integrated with the EVMs to cross check one's vision and the choice that is pressed at the time of voting. With this, the device can warn the voter if he/she has pressed the wrong choice.



PROS:
#Thus, with such smart boards, voting will become more confidential and secured, plus the voters will not have to worry about others who are around.

#Azure Blockchain can come handy to handle the recorded data from the boards.

#Votes can be counted in real time and flashed as soon as the polling ends.

CONS:
The board setup may record a false choice if the voter is having squinted eyes. For this, the setup has to be trained well to identify the right choice.
