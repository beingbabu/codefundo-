***Microsoft Hackathon | Secure Electronic Voting using Azure Blockchain***

So here's a little advancement over the latest EVMs. 

What i feel is that the latest EVM's still breach the privacy, let's say because of the person who is assisting us with the use of the machine.

How about having a relevant size of a board that has **eye trackers** intsalled?
> Once a voter sets his/her eye on a particular symbol out of many symbols present on the board, let's say for 5 seconds, that particular choice will be recorded instatntly.
> Such eye trackers will have to be very precise to capture the voter's target choice.

_These eye trackers can further be integrated with the EVMs to cross check one's vision and the choice that is pressed at the time of voting. With this, the device can warn the voter if he/she has pressed the wrong choice._

_The smart boards will have digital displays for displaying the symbol sets. That means a symbol set can be uploaded to the display for multiple constituencies. Thus, the voters living in a different location will be able to vote for their constituency with the smart board being set accordingly, in their allotted time. The recorded data will be directed to store in respective constituency instantly._
>The entrance to such smart boards will have biometric verification for the voters to approve their chance for voting. This will restrict voters to vote multiple times and from multiple constituencies.

_Rest of the database for approval and maintenance has to be handled by the application. The app will have entries of the voters depending on the region in a well categorized manner._
>One can easily see his/her name as a voter in the list, once he/she logs in to the database. The officials will be uploading new entries as per the birth taking place in that area. And when that entry reaches 18, the app will add them in the list as well as notify the candidate via suitable medium.
>The list present in the database will ensure effective poll and mark the status of the voters who have cast their vote.
>The application will also contain a section of candidates with their ratings which will help the voters to know the necessary parameters about the candidate.



**PROS:**
>Thus, with such smart boards, voting will become more confidential and secured, plus the voters will not have to worry about others who are around.

>Azure Blockchain can come handy to handle the recorded data from the boards.

>Votes can be counted in real time and flashed as soon as the polling ends.

**CONS:**
>The board setup may record a false choice if the voter is having squinted eyes. For this, the setup has to be trained well to identify the right choice.
